## What's RainyArch?
RainyArch is a set of frameworks and application prototypes for Agile development with Java and .Net and Javascript.

You can use the application prototypes (on top of the frameworks) to get a quick start of your application development.
Just download(the source),set up, build and run, then it is yours.
With the prototype running on your server, you've finished the first round iteration of your application's agile development.
(See www.51chunzhen.com for detailed introduction and the prototype on the run.)

The frameworks provide simple and robust programming interfaces and patterns so that the prototypes can smoothly evolve and scale up to a full-featured application to meet your customers' requirements.
The prototypes are built on top of the frameworks. But if you're not interested in the prototypes, you can use the frameworks alone and develop your own applications on top.

## What are in RainyArch?
RainyArch contains two application prototypes and three frameworks.

1. java web project JavaNgArch  - a web application with a mysql database.
2. C# solution NetNgArch  - a web application with a mssqlserver database.
3. java package named "projectbase" - a server-side framework encapsulating and integrating Hibernate+SpringIOC+SpringMVC+JSP.
4. C# project named "ProjectBase" - a server-side framework encapsulating and integrating NHibernate+CastleWindsorIOC+ASP.NetMVC+Spark/Razor.
5. javascript files named "ProjectBase_*.js" - a client-side framework encapsulating and integrating AngularJS+AngularUI(bootstrap)+UIRouter+AutoValidate.

You can combine one of the server-side frameworks with the client-side framework as the prototypes do. They are bounded to cooperate so that programming for both sides can easily and smoothly proceed as a whole. 
 
Or you can just choose to use any one of the frameworks alone. For instance, if your application has a non-browser client, or a server which is not written in java or C#, you are free to use whatever you have or you¡¯ll create for one side, as long as you make them match the simple interfaces the framework provides for the other side. 
In fact, the prototypes even contain a desktop client sample to show how the server-side framework work without the client-side framework.
